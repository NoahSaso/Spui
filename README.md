# Spui

I think the Spotify iOS app is buggy and has a bunch of non-intuitive or unhelpful interactions. This is hopefully going to be a replacement that fixes many of these undesirable patterns.

- Clicking on a song should add to queue if I already have something playing, not replace my position in the playlist, album, or radio that's currently playing.
- Adding songs to playlists in bulk is a pain.
- More stuff like this :)
